## You will need
- A mancala board, or 12 small and 2 large bowls.
- 48 stones, marbles, or tokens.

## Setup
If you don't have a mancala board, place your small bowls a grid that is 6 wide, and 2 long. Place the large bowls on either side. The large bowl on each player's right is their 'home' bowl.

Place 4 stones in each small bowl.

Choose a player to take the first turn by any means.

## Play
Each player, in turn, picks up the stones from one of the 6 bowls in front of them, and places one stone in each of the subsequent bowls, going counter-clockwise, until they run out of stones, skipping the opponent's home bowl.

!example: Suppose you pick from the 2nd bowl, which has 2 stones. You empty the 2nd bowl, and place 1 stone in the 3rd bowl, and 1 stone in the 4th.

There are 2 special conditions during play:

1. If a player's last stone lands on your home bowl, that player gets another turn.
2. If a player's last stone lands in an empty bowl on their side, they move that stone and any stones directly across that bowl to their home bowl.

Once a player has no more stones on their side, the game ends. The remaining stones on the other side are moved to the other player's home bowl.

The player with the most stones in their home bowl wins.
