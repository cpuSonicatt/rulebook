                </div>

                <h2>You will need</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li>A mancala board, or 12 small and 2 large bowls.</li>
<li>48 stones, marbles, or tokens.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2><hr><p>If you don&#39;t have a mancala board, place your small bowls a grid that is 6 wide, and 2 long. Place the large bowls on either side. The large bowl on each player&#39;s right is their &#39;home&#39; bowl.</p><p>Place 4 stones in each small bowl.</p><p>Choose a player to take the first turn by any means.</p><h2>Play</h2><hr><p>Each player, in turn, picks up the stones from one of the 6 bowls in front of them, and places one stone in each of the subsequent bowls, going counter-clockwise, until they run out of stones, skipping the opponent&#39;s home bowl.</p>
        <div class="callout c-example">
            <p><b>Example</b>: Suppose you pick from the 2nd bowl, which has 2 stones. You empty the 2nd bowl, and place 1 stone in the 3rd bowl, and 1 stone in the 4th.</p>
        </div>
        <p>There are 2 special conditions during play:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a player&#39;s last stone lands on your home bowl, that player gets another turn.</li>
<li>If a player&#39;s last stone lands in an empty bowl on their side, they move that stone and any stones directly across that bowl to their home bowl.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a player has no more stones on their side, the game ends. The remaining stones on the other side are moved to the other player&#39;s home bowl.</p><p>The player with the most stones in their home bowl wins.</p>
