                    <li>A standard 52-card deck.</li>

                <p>Choose a dealer by whichever means.</p>
                <p>Each player is dealt 3 cards in front of them face-down, 3 cards face-up on top of the face-down cards, and 3 cards to their hand. The rest of the cards are placed in a draw pile face-down in the center.</p>
                <p>Before beginning, each player may swap out any number of cards between their hand and their face-up cards.</p>

                <h2>Play</h2><hr>
                <p>Play begins with the player on the dealer's left. The object of the game is to play all the cards from your hand, then all your cards on the table.</p>
                <p>Each player in turn places up to 4 cards of the same value in the center; the discard pile. The next player must play up to 4 cards of equal or higher value. If a player cannot play a card, they must pick up the discard pile.</p>
                <div class="callout note">
                    <p><b>Note</b>: Ace is high.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Unless the draw pile is exhausted, players must have a minimum of 3 cards in their hand.</p>
                <p>Only when a player's hand is exhausted are allowed to play their face-up cards. If a player has to pick up any cards at any point, they must play them first before continuing to play their face-up cards. This rule applies to their face-down cards as well.</p>
                <p>Once a player has played all of their face-up cards, they're able to play their face-down cards. Players must not look at their face-down cards before playing one.</p>

                <p>Once a player plays all 3 of their face-down cards, they are out. There are no winners in Shithead. Instead, the last player still in is the loser; or the 'Shithead'. They then become the dealer for the next round.</p>
