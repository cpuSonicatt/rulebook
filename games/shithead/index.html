                <h2>You will need</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li>A standard 52-card deck</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deal</h2><hr>
        <div class="callout rank">
            <p><b>Cards rank (from low to high)</b>: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A</p>
        </div>
        <p>Choose a dealer by whichever means.</p><p>Each player is dealt 3 cards in front of them face-down, 3 cards face-up on top of the face-down cards, and 3 cards to their hand. The rest of the cards are placed in a draw pile face-down in the center.</p><p>Before beginning, each player may swap out any number of cards between their hand and their face-up cards.</p><h2>Play</h2><hr><p>Play begins with the player on the dealer&#39;s left. The object of the game is to play all the cards from your hand, then all your cards on the table.</p><p>Each player in turn places up to 4 cards of the same value in the center; the discard pile. The next player must play up to 4 cards of equal or higher value. If a player cannot play a card, they must pick up the discard pile.</p><p>Unless the draw pile is exhausted, players must have a minimum of 3 cards in their hand.</p><p>Only when a player&#39;s hand is exhausted are allowed to play their face-up cards. If a player has to pick up any cards at any point, they must play them first before continuing to play their face-up cards. This rule applies to their face-down cards as well.</p><p>Once a player has played all of their face-up cards, they&#39;re able to play their face-down cards. Players must not look at their face-down cards before playing one.</p><p>Once a player plays all 3 of their face-down cards, they are out. There are no winners in Shithead. Instead, the last player still in is the loser; or the &#39;Shithead&#39;. They then become the dealer for the next round.</p><h2>Wildcards</h2><hr><p>Some cards are considered wildcards, and have special rules when played.</p>
