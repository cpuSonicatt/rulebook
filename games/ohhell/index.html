                <p>Place the rest of the cards face down in the middle, and reveal the top card. This card's suit is the <b>trump suit</b> for the round.</p>

                <p>For each subsequent round, players are dealt 1 less card than the previous round until they're dealt 1 card. After that, players are dealt 1 more card than the previous round until they reach back to the amount of cards from the first round.</p>

                    <p><b>Note</b>: this means that the number of rounds in a game is twice the amount of cards dealt in the first round, minus 1.</p>

                <h2>Bidding</h2><hr>

                <p>Before play begins there is a bidding round, where each player starting left of the dealer estimates how many tricks they think they can win in the round. Non-dealers can bid between 0 (losing all tricks) and the amount of cards in their hand (winning all tricks). The dealer, who bids last, must not bid an amount that would make the total amount of bids be equal to the amount of cards in the round.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>Play</h2><hr>

                <p>Play begins with each player starting with the dealer placing 1 card; leading the trick.</p>
                <p>The first card played is the <b>turn suit</b>, and the rest of the cards played in the round must be of the same suit, if possible. If a player can't play a card in the <b>turn suit</b>, then they can play any card instead.</p>
                <p>After each player has played 1 card, you can determine the winner of the trick. The player who plays the highest card in the <b>trump suit</b>, or the highest card in the <b>turn suit</b> if no <b>trump suit</b> has been played, wins the trick.</p>
                <p>The winner of the trick takes the played cards for themselves (face down beside them, to keep track of total tricks won), then leads the trick for the next round.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>Scoring</h2><hr>
                <p>Once all cards in a round have been played, you can calculate each player's score for the round.</p>
                <p>Every player gets 1 point per trick they won.</p>
                <p>If a player bid the exact amount of tricks (not under or over) they won, they gain a bonus 10 points.</p>
