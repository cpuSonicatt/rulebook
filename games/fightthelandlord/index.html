                <h2>You will need</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li>A standard 52-card deck, with 2 different-coloured jokers</li>
<li><em>Optional</em>: Coins/chips/tokens to represent bids (around 25 units per player), or a pen-and-paper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deal</h2><hr>
        <div class="callout rank">
            <p><b>Cards rank (from low to high)</b>: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2, Black Joker, Red Joker.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Choose a dealer by any means.</p><p>Shuffle and deal 17 cards to each player. Place the remaining 3 cards aside face-down for later.</p><h2>Auction</h2><hr><p>The players enter an auction and bid to determine who the landlord will be. You&#39;re bidding for how strong you think your hand is.</p><p>The possible bids are 1, 2, and 3. The dealer starts the bid, or may pass, and continues counter-clockwise until 2 players pass, or 1 player bids 3. If all 3 players pass, re-deal.</p><p>The winner of the auction is the landlord, and add the 3 cards that were set aside to their hand. The two other players are the tenants.</p><h2>Play</h2><hr><p>The landlord begins by playing a single card, or a legal combination. Each subsequent player, going counter-clockwise, much either pass, or play a higher rank in the same combination of cards. For example, a pair of 6s can be followed by a pair of 7s, but not a pair of 5s (or a triplet of 8s, etc.)</p><p>There are two exceptions to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you play &#39;bomb&#39;</li>
<li>If you play a &#39;rocket&#39;</li>
</ol>
<p>If either a bomb or a rocket, the bid is doubled.</p><p>When 2 players pass consecutively, then the player who played cards last may lead with a new combination. Play continues until 1 player has discarded all their cards.</p><p>If the landlord wins, the tenants must each pay the landlord the bid amount. If either tenant wins, the landlord pays each tenant the bid amount.</p><h2>Combinations</h2><hr><p>The combinations of cards are as follows, ordered by their strength:</p>
