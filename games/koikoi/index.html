                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hanafuda</b> - the name of the deck of cards.</li>
                    <li>the <b>Oya</b> - "parent"; dealer.</li>
                    <li>the <b>Ko</b> - "child"; the other player.</li>
                    <li><b>Field</b> - the face-up cards on the table.</li>
                    <li><b>Draw pile</b> - the pile of cards remaining from the deal, placed next to the field.</li>
                    <li><b>Point pile</b> - where you put your matched cards on the table.</li>
                    <li>a <b>yaku</b> - a special combination of cards that score points.</li>
                    <li><b>"koi-koi"</b> - "Come on!"; the signifier to continue playing the round.</li>
                    <li><b>"stop"</b> - the signifier to stop playing the round.</li>
                    <li>a <b>month</b> - a suit that makes up the deck.</li>

            <div class="box">
                <h2><b>Deal</b></h2><hr>
                <p>Choose an <b>Oya</b> (either randomly or by both players drawing a single card and whoever's card is earliest. If both cards are the same <b>month</b>, whichever is highest in value. If both are the same value, retry).</p>
                <p>The <b>Oya</b> deals 8 cards to the <b>Ko</b> face down, then 8 cards to the <b>field</b> face up, and then 8 cards face down to themselves. This can be done in any way but is typically done in 2- or 4-card chunks. Set aside the rest of the cards to form a <b>draw pile</b>.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p><b>Tip</b>:</p>
                    <p>Since you deal half of the cards in the deck, you can split the deck evenly and hold the exact amount, which may aid dealing since <b>Hanafuda</b> cards are smaller and bulkier than standard western playing cards.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Before starting the round, check for <a href="#lucky">'Lucky Hands' or misdeals</a>.</p>
                <p>You should also decide if you wish to include <a href="#moon">the Moon Viewing and Cherry Blossom Viewing yaku</a>.</p>

                <h2><b>Play</b></h2><hr>
                <p>The game is played across 12 rounds, corresponding to each <b>month</b> (round 1 is January, round 2 is February, etc.).</p>
                <p>Play begins with the <b>Oya</b>, with each turn having two stages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Match 1 card from your hand with a card on the <b>field</b>, or place a card on the <b>field</b> if you cannot make a match.</li>
                    <li>Match 1 card from the top of the <b>draw pile</b> with a card on the <b>field</b>, or place the card on the <b>field</b> if you cannot make a match.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>At either stage of your turn:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a choice between 2 cards on the <b>field</b> to match with, you must choose 1.</li>
                    <li>If you have a choice between 3 cards on the <b>field</b> to match with, you must collect all 3.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Matched cards then go to your <b>point pile</b>, face up.</p>
                <p>At the end of your turn, if there is a new <b>yaku</b> present, or an improvement to any existing <b>yaku</b>, in your <b>point pile</b> and a player hasn't previously declared <b>"koi-koi"</b> in the current round, you must choose to either <b>"koi-koi"</b> or <b>"stop"</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>"koi-koi"</b> - The player calls <b>"koi-koi"</b>, and the round continues.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By calling <b>"koi-koi"</b>, you attempt to make a better <b>yaku</b> for yourself at the risk of your opponent making a new <b>yaku</b> too.</li>
                        <li>If either player had called <b>"koi-koi"</b> in the current round and either player makes a new <b>yaku</b>, or improves upon existing <b>yaku</b>, then the round is over.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>"stop"</b> - The player calls <b>"stop"</b>, and the round ends.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By calling <b>"stop"</b>, you bank the value of your <b>yaku</b>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>If both players run out of cards to play, the round is void.</p>
                <p>When the round is over, the winning player scores the cards in their <b>point pile</b>, and the <b>Oya</b> and <b>Ko</b> change to whoever won and lost the round, respectively. Play continues into the next round.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p><b>Tip</b>:</p>
                    <p>It's a good idea to organise your <b>point pile</b> to help you identify <b>yaku</b>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place any Chaff cards closest to you, leaving a 1-card gap between the edge of the table and the Chaff.</li>
                        <li>Place any Animals above your Chaff.</li>
                        <li>Place any Slips above your Animals.</li>
                        <li>Place any Lights above your Slips.</li>
                        <li>If you match the Sake Cup, place it in the gap in between your Animals and Chaff.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Separating the Sake Cup from the Animal or Chaff cards may help you identify both Viewings <b>yaku</b>, the 5-or-more Animals <b>yaku</b>, and the 10-or-more Chaff <b>yaku</b>.</p>
                </div>

                <h2><b>Scoring</b></h2><hr>
                <p>A player's score for the round is based on all the <b>yaku</b> in the <b>point pile</b> <a href="#yaku">listed below</a>. There are a couple of special modifiers which may apply as well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a player's score is worth 7 points or more, their score for that round doubles.</li>
                    <li>If a player had called <b>"koi-koi"</b> in the current round and the other player makes a <b>yaku</b>, the other player's score for that round doubles.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="lucky"><b>'Lucky hands' and misdeals</b></h2><hr>
                <p>'Lucky hands' are either:</p>

                    <li>all cards in a single <b>month</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a player is dealt a 'lucky hand', they are instantly awarded 6 points, and the round ends.</p>
                <p>If both players are dealt a 'lucky hand', or if either of these hands are dealt to the <b>field</b> instead, the round is declared void.</p>

                <h2><b>Void rounds</b></h2><hr>
