                <h2>You will need</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A standard 52-card deck.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>Deal</h2><hr>
                <p>Choose a dealer by whichever means.</p>
                <p>Split the deck between both players, and both make the following stacks to form the tableau:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 card face-up.</li>
                    <li>1 card face-down, and 1 card face-up.</li>
                    <li>2 cards face-down, and 1 card face-up.</li>
                    <li>3 cards face-down, and 1 card face-up</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The remaining cards are the player's stock. Place them to one side.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>Play</h2><hr>
                <p>There are no turns in Spit. Both players, on the count of 3, turn over the top card of their stock onto a new discard pile.</p>
                <p>Using the cards face up on the tableau, and with only 1 hand, each player must place a card that is one value higher or lower than the top card of either discard pile. Colour and suit doesn't matter, and King wraps around to Ace.</p>
                <p>You can only have up to 4 cards face-up at a time, meaning you will need to flip over cards in your tableau during play.</p>
                <p>If no moves can be made then both players, on the count of 3, draw 1 card from the top of the stock pile and play it onto the discard pile. Play resumes.</p>
                <p>Once your tableau is exhausted, claim a side (ideally the side with the fewest cards) and gather up that side's stock and discard cards. The other player claims the side not chosen.</p>
                <p>Shuffle these cards together and deal out another tableau. A tableau may not have the required number of cards to complete.</p>
                <p>The first player to lose all their cards wins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>Handicaps</h2><hr>
                <p>In normal play, players must only use 1 hand to play cards. This rule can be relaxed to aid new players by allowing them to use both hands, or tightened by forcing a player to use their non-dominant hand.</p>
