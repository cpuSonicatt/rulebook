</ul>
<h2>Deal</h2><hr>
        <div class="callout note">
            <p><b>Note</b>: This is the traditional method of dealing, used in competitive play to prevent cheating. For casual games, players can take tiles from right-most side of the dealer&#39;s wall.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Shuffle the tiles by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling#Corgi">&quot;washing&quot; them</a> on the table, and choose a player to be East. Going counter-clockwise, the other players will be South, West, and North.</p><p>Make 4 walls of 17 tiles long and 2 high in a square shape.</p><p>The East player rolls 3d6 and, moving counter-clockwise starting with themselves, counts the sum of the roll to choose a wall to &quot;break&quot;.</p><p>The player whose wall is chosen then rolls 3d6 again to choose a break point, counting right-to-left the sum of the roll.</p><p>At the break point each player, starting with the East player and moving counter-clockwise, takes chunks of 4 tiles (2 by 2) to form their hand.</p><p>Once each player has 12 tiles, each player takes 1 tile to reach 13, and the East player takes 1 more to reach 14. The East player can take both tiles at the same time, so long as the order of who would take the tiles is the same.</p><p>Play then begins when the East player discards a tile.</p><h2>Play</h2><hr><p>Play starts with the South player and moves counter-clockwise.</p><p>Each player at the beginning of their turn may either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw a tile from the live end of the wall</li>
<li>Claim the most recent discarded tile to make a Melded Run, Melded Triplet, or Big Melded Quad</li>
</ol>
<p>Claiming a discarded tile is a special move, of which there are steps listed below to follow.</p><p>Otherwise, a player should draw a tile from the wall. If they want to they may declare a Concealed Quad or a Small Melded Quad, which are also special moves.</p><p>If a player has a winning hand (4 runs/triplets/quads and a pair, or an irregular hand), they may call Mahjong and win the round.</p>
        <div class="callout note">
            <p><b>Note</b>: If there&#39;s a conflict in claims, then Mahjong beats Quads/Triplets, beats Runs. To tiebreak, the player closest to the dealer by turn order takes precedence.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If no special move is played and the player can&#39;t or decides not to call Mahjong, then the player discards a tile to the center and their turn is over.</p><p>If there are no more tiles to draw at the beginning of a player&#39;s turn, then no player wins and the game goes into the next round.</p><p>The game lasts 4 to 12 rounds, and the role of the dealer rotates counter-clockwise after every round.</p><p>Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only score the hand of the player that calls Mahjong, even if other players have winning hands.</li>
<li>If a winning hand&#39;s value exceeds 320 points, they score 320 points or the value of the highest-valued pattern in the hand, whichever is higher.</li>
<li>If a winning player claims a tile from another player, and that same tile was discarded in the same &quot;go around&quot; (last 4 turns), the player who first discarded that tile is &quot;responsible&quot;, and the winning player receives payment from that player instead. If the winner is the one who first discarded that tile, they win by self-draw instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Calling Mahjong</h2><hr><p>As soon as a player has a winning hand, they may call Mahjong to win the round.</p><p>If you draw a tile to make a winning hand, you win by self-draw.</p><p>If another player discard a tile that&#39;s needed by you to make a winning hand, you win by discard.</p><p>If another player makes a Small Melded Quad, and you require that tile to make a winning hand, you win by robbing a quad.</p><h2>Special moves</h2><hr><p>There are a few special moves players can make instead of drawing a tile from the wall, or before discarding a tile:</p><h4>Discarded</h4><p><strong>Melded Triplet</strong> - If you have a concealed pair in your hand, and the most recently discarded tile would make a triplet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call &quot;Triplet&quot;</li>
<li>Take the discarded tile, and lay the triplet, face up, next to your hand</li>
<li>Discard a tile</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Melded Run</strong> - If you have a two concealed consecutive tiles in your hand, and the most recently discarded tile would make a run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call &quot;Run&quot;</li>
<li>Take the discarded tile, and lay the run, face up, next to your hand</li>
<li>Discard a tile</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Big Melded Quad</strong> - If you have a concealed triplet in your hand, and the most recently discarded tile would make a quad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call &quot;Quad&quot;</li>
<li>Take the discarded tile, and lay the quad, face up, next to your hand</li>
<li>Draw a supplement tile from the dead end of the wall</li>
<li><em>Optionally, call Concealed Quad or Small Melded Quad, and follow that move&#39;s steps instead</em></li>
<li>Discard a tile</li>
</ol>
<h4>Self-drawn</h4><p><strong>Small Melded Quad</strong> - If you&#39;ve already played a melded triplet, and you draw a tile that would make it a quad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call &quot;Quad&quot;</li>
<li>Add the 4th tile to the melded triplet to make the quad</li>
<li>Draw a supplement tile from the dead end of the wall</li>
<li><em>Optionally, call Concealed Quad or Small Melded Quad, and follow that move&#39;s steps instead</em></li>
<li>Discard a tile</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concealed Quad</strong> - If you have a concealed triplet in your hand, and you draw a tile that would make it a quad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call &quot;Quad&quot;</li>
<li>Lay the quad, with the two outside tiles face down and the two inside tiles face up, next to your hand</li>
<li>Draw a supplement tile from the dead end of the wall</li>
<li><em>Optionally, call Concealed Quad or Small Melded Quad, and follow that move&#39;s steps instead</em></li>
<li>Discard a tile</li>
</ol>
<h2>Patterns</h2><hr><p>Patterns are sorted into categories and series (e.g. &quot;Three Identical Runs&quot; is notated as 5.1.3, or 5th category, 1st series, 3rd pattern). Only the highest scoring pattern in each series counts towards a player&#39;s score. i.e. you can&#39;t score on both 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.</p><p>If the winning player wins by self-draw, the losing players pays the winning player the value of the winning hand.</p><p>If the winning player wins by discard or by robbing a quad, the player that discarded/melded the required tile pays the winning player 3 times the value of the winning hand.</p>
        <div class="callout note">
            <p><b>Note</b>: You&#39;re free to arrange your hand to however you want to match patterns. Hands can ony be scored on one arrangement. For example, a hand can be arranged to score either Three Consecutive Triplets (7.2.1) or Three Identical Runs (5.1.3), but not both.</p>
