                <p>To make a set, you must have 3 cards that either run in a consecutive sequence in the same suit, or a group of the same value. e.g. a run of 3<span class="r">♥</span>, 4<span class="r">♥</span>, 5<span class="r">♥</span> , or a group of 6<span class="r">♥</span>, 6<span class="r">♦</span>, 6♣.</p>

                <p>You can also add a card to an existing run or group.</p>
                <p>You then must discard a card to the discard pile, face-up. You may discard the card you picked up in the same turn.</p>
                <p>If you run out of cards from the stock pile, place the top discarded card aside, shuffle the rest of the discarded cards and form a new stock, and start a new discard pile with the card left out.</p>
                <p>The winner is the player who ends up with no cards in their hand at the end of their turn, or has no cards to discard.</p>
