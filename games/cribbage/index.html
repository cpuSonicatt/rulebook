                <p>Play begins with the player on the dealer's left. Scoring opportunities are called-out in red. The game ends as soon as a player reaches 121.</p>

                <p>Starting with the player on the dealer's left, each player places a card and announces the count (the cumulative value of all the cards played so far). The count can't go over 31.</p>

                <p>A player must play a card if they're able to. If a player can't play a card, they pass.</p>
                <p>Once no more cards can be played, the count resets and the already-played cards are turned over. This continues until all cards are played.</p>

                <h5>Show</h5>
                <p>Starting with the dealer's hand, going clockwise, and ending with the dealer's box, players reveal and score their cards:</p>
                <div class="callout score">
                    <p>Combinations of cards that add up to 15 scores 2 points each.</p>

                <div class="callout score">
                    <p>Combinations of 3 or more cards that form a consecutive run score the number of cards in the run.</p>

                <div class="callout score">
                    <p>A pair, three-of-a-kind, and four-of-a-kind score 2, 6 and 12 points respectively.</p>

                <div class="callout score">
                    <p>Four-card flushes (all 4 cards in your hand only, excluding the box) score 4 points. Five-card flushes (all 4 cards in your hand only plus the cut card) score 5 points.</p>

                <div class="callout score">
                    <p>Having a Jack of the same suit as the cut card scores 1 point.</p>
                </div>
