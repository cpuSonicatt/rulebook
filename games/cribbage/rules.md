## You will need

- A standard 52-card deck
- A cribbage board, or a pen-and-paper to keep score

## Deal and Discard

Choose a dealer by whichever means.

~ **For 2 players**: Deal 6 cards to each player.

~ **For 3 players**: Deal 5 cards to each player, and deal 1 card to the center.

~ **For 4 players**: Deal 5 cards to each player.

Each player should retain 4 cards, and discard the remainder to the center (known as the 'box'). The 'box' acts as the dealer's 2nd hand; and the dealer scores its worth. The center should also have 4 cards.

Set the rest of the cards to one side, face down.

## Play

!note: Face cards are worth 10 points, and Aces are worth 1 point.

Play begins with the player on the dealer's left. Points are awarded immediately as they become apparent. The game ends as soon as a player reaches 121 points.

There are 3 stages to play:

#### Cut

The player to the left of the dealer cuts the remaining cards, and the dealer reveals the top card of the lower half and places it face up on the remaining card pile.

!score: If the revealed card is a Jack, the dealer scores 2 points

#### Play

Starting with the player on the dealer's left, each player places a card and announces the count (the cumulative value of all the cards played so far).

!score: If a player plays a card to make the count equal 15, they score 2 points.

!score: If a player plays a card to make a pair, a three-of-a-kind, or a four-of-a-kind, they score 2, 6, and 12 points, respectively.

!score: If a player plays a card to make a run of 3 or more, they score the number of cards in the run.

The count must not exceed 31.

!score: If a player plays a card to make the count equal 31, they score 1 point.

A player must play a card if they're able to. If a player can't play a card, they pass.

!score: If a player played the last card of a round, they score 1 point.

Once no more cards can be played, the count resets and the already-played cards are turned over. This continues until all cards are played.

#### Show

Starting with the dealer's hand, going clockwise, and ending with the dealer's 'box', players reveal and score their cards.

!score: Combinations of cards that add up to 15 scores 2 points each.

!score: Combinations of 3 or more cards that form a consecutive run score the number of cards in the run.

!score: Any pair, a three-of-a-kind, and a four-of-a-kind score 2, 6 and 12 points respectively.

!score: Hand flushes (all four of your held cards are the same suit) scores 4. This **does not** apply when scoring the 'box'.

!score: Box flush (all four of the box cards, plus the cut card, are the same suit) scores 5. This **only** applies when scoring the 'box'.

If no player has won, the dealer changes to the next player.
