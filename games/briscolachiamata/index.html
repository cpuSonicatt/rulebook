                </div>

                <h2>You will need</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li>A standard 52-card deck</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deal</h2><hr><p>Discard all 7&#39;s, 8&#39;s, and 9&#39;s from the deck. These cards aren&#39;t required for play.</p><p>Choose a dealer by whichever means.</p><p>The dealer deals out all cards to every player.</p>
        <div class="callout rank">
            <p><b>Card ranks (low to high)</b>: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, J, Q, K, 10, A</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="callout note">
            <p><b>Note</b>: This game is usually played with an Italian 40-card deck, where there are no 8&#39;s, 9&#39;s, or 10&#39;s.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Auction</h2><hr><p>The player left of the dealer starts the bidding by naming any rank. Subsequent bids must be lower in rank. If a player bids &#39;2&#39;, players may bid &#39;2&#39; with a point value between 60 and 120. This number represents the number of points a player thinks their team will win (which they will then need to achieve in order to win). When bidding with these numbers. These subsequent bids must be higher in value.</p><p>Players may also pass, and sit out the rest of the auction.</p>
        <div class="callout c-example">
            <p><b>Example</b>: Alice bids &#39;Ace&#39;, Bob passes, Charlie bids &#39;5&#39;, David bids &#39;2&#39;, Elliot bids &#39;2, 70&#39;, Alice bids &#39;2, 71&#39;, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The player that wins the auction gets to name the trump suit for the round.</p><p>The players are then split into 2 teams:</p>
<ol>
<li>The auction winner, and the player who holds the card that matches the winning rank, and chosen suit.</li>
<li>The other players.</li>
</ol>
<p>The player who holds the matching card must not reveal themselves to anyone. This person may also be the auction winner.</p>
        <div class="callout c-example">
            <p><b>Example</b>: #1 - Alice wins the bid with &#39;J&#39;, and chooses &#39;Hearts&#39; as the trump suit. David has the Jack of Hearts, so is secretly on Alice&#39;s team.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="callout c-example">
            <p><b>Example</b>: #2 - Charlie wins the bid with &#39;5&#39;, and chooses &#39;Clubs&#39; as the trump suit. Charlie has the 5 of Clubs, so is secretly in a team on their own.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Play</h2><hr><p>The auction winner starts the first trick by placing a card from their hand to the center of the table. This card is the turn suit.</p><p>Each player then, in turn going clockwise, places a card from their hand to the center of the table in an attempt to win the trick.</p>
        <div class="callout note">
            <p><b>Note</b>: Unlike other trick-taking games, any card can be played following the lead card.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once everyone has placed 1 card, determine the winner of that round&#39;s trick:</p>
<ol>
<li>The player who played the highest-ranking trump-suited card.</li>
<li>If no trump-suited cards were played, the player who played the highest-ranking turn-suited card.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Scoring</h2><hr><p>Once 8 rounds have been played, players reveal themselves as to which team they were on, and score their tricks. The amount of tricks doesn&#39;t matter. Instead, scoring is based on the card ranks in the tricks:</p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
<th>Rank</th>
<th>Points</th>
</tr>

            <tr>
<td>Ace</td>
<td>11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ten</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jack</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

        </table>
        <p>All other ranks score 0.</p><p>The total amount of points in a deck is 120, so the team with a combined trick score of at least 61 points, or the number of points bid, scores game points. The winning team scores positive points, and the losing team scores negative points.</p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
<th>Bid Points</th>
<th>AW&#39;s team (with teammate)*</th>
<th>AW&#39;s team (alone)*</th>
<th>Other team</th>
</tr>

            <tr>
<td>61-70</td>
<td>±2</td>
<td>±4</td>
<td>±1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>71-80</td>
<td>±4</td>
<td>±8</td>
<td>±2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>81-90</td>
<td>±6</td>
<td>±12</td>
<td>±3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>91-100</td>
<td>±8</td>
<td>±16</td>
<td>±4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101+</td>
<td>±10</td>
<td>±20</td>
<td>±5</td>
</tr>
