## You will need
- A standard 52-card deck
- Coins/chips/tokens (around 50 per person)

## Deal
Choose a dealer by whichever means.

Each player antes 1 chip to the pot, unless required to pay more from a previous round.

The dealer deals 5 cards to each player face-down. The dealer's last card is dealt face-up, and this card's suit is the trump suit for the round.

!rank: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.

## Decide
Players look at their cards and decide whether to play or pass.

Once everyone is ready to decide, everyone simultaneously reveals their decision by placing either a chip (for play), or nothing (for pass) in their hand, and showing everyone else after a countdown.

If a player decides to play, they may discard some or all of their cards, and the dealer deals an equal number of replacement cards. Players, if they wish, may keep their hand instead.

If a player decides to pass, they forfeit the round. They place the cards face down in front of them and sit out the round.

If only 1 player remains in play, they automatically win the pot. The round is then over.

## Play
!note: If new to Bourr√©, it may be a good idea for the dealer to keep a note of the trump suit.

The player left of the dealer leads the first trick by placing a card face-up in the center. This card's suit is the turn suit. Players must then, in turn going clockwise, place a card to try and win the trick.

The play of these subsequent cards must:

1. Play a card of the same suit as the turn suit if possible;
2. If unable to play the same suit, play the trump suit if possible.

In addition, players must also play a card that beats the highest card played so far, if possible.

Otherwise, a player may play any card.

Once each player has played 1 card, determine the winner of the trick.

Trump cards beat turn cards. Higher-ranking trump cards beat lower-ranking trump cards, and higher-ranking turn cards beat lower-ranking turn cards.

Play then continues to the next turn.

## Score
Once there are no more cards to play, the round can be scored.

The player who wins the most tricks wins the pot.

If there is a tie in the number of won tricks, the pot is 'split', and remains into the next round.

Any player that scores no tricks must each ante the number of chips in the pot for the next round, instead of 1.
