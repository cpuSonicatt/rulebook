## You will need
- A standard 52-card deck.

## Deal

Choose a dealer by whichever means.

The dealer deals out 13 cards to both players. The rest of the cards are set down to one side. This pile is called the 'talon'.

Turn up the top card of the talon. This card's suit is the game's trump suit.

!tip: Note down this trump suit, as the upturned card for each round changes, whist the trump suit doesn't.

!rank: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.

## Play

On their turn, starting with the non-dealer, each player plays 1 card to the trick. The responding player then, if they're able to, must play a card of the same suit. This is the turn suit.

The trick is won by the player who played the best card. If both cards are of the same suit, the player who played the higher card wins. If the responding player played a trump suit card, they win. Otherwise, the first player wins.

The winner of the trick then takes the upturned card from the talon and leads the next trick. The other player takes the next card from the talon, which is kept hidden, and flips the top card.

When the talon is exhausted, and cards cannot be replenished, won tricks are counted. The winner of the game is the player who wins the most tricks from this point.
