                <h2>You will need</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li>A standard 52-card deck</li>
<li>Betting chips</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terms</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>see</strong> - betting double the current bet amount to end the betting sequence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deal</h2><hr><p>Choose a dealer by whichever means.</p><p>Before dealing, each player antes 1 chip.</p><p>Each player is dealt 3 cards face down, and a single round of betting begins starting with the player left of the dealer.</p><h2>Play</h2><hr><p>Play revolves around betting for the best hand.</p><p>During betting, a player may decide to fold, or bet any number of their chips. Each subsequent bet must be equal or over the previous.</p><p>Players may also bet blind, meaning they don&#39;t see their cards. If a player is betting blind, their chips are worth double. That player may look at their cards at any point, at which point their chips return to normal value.</p><p>Folded cards are not reveled. Instead, they are placed at the bottom of the deck.</p><p>Betting continues until there are two players remaining, at which point either player may bet double the current amount to &quot;see&quot; their opponent, or continue betting as normal.</p><p>However, during a showdown (2 players remaining) if one player is blind and the other isn&#39;t, the player who isn&#39;t blind may not call to &quot;see&quot; the opponent&#39;s cards.</p><p>Once a player has bet to &quot;see&quot; the opponent&#39;s hand, both hands are then revealed and the best hand wins the pot. If there&#39;s a tie, the player who is &quot;seeing&quot; loses.</p><p>After play, the remaining cards are placed at the bottom of the deck. If a hand is seen and won by a prial, then the deck is shuffled. Otherwise, the deck is dealt unshuffled.</p><h2>Hand ranks</h2><hr>
