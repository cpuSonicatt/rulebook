## You will need

- A standard 52-card deck
- Betting chips

## Terms

- **see** - betting double the current bet amount to end the betting sequence

## Deal

Choose a dealer by whichever means.

Before dealing, each player antes 1 chip.

Each player is dealt 3 cards face down, and a single round of betting begins starting with the player left of the dealer.

## Play

Play revolves around betting for the best hand.

During betting, a player may decide to fold, or bet any number of their chips. Each subsequent bet must be equal or over the previous.

Players may also bet blind, meaning they don't see their cards. If a player is betting blind, their chips are worth double. That player may look at their cards at any point, at which point their chips return to normal value.

Folded cards are not reveled. Instead, they are placed at the bottom of the deck.

Betting continues until there are two players remaining, at which point either player may bet double the current amount to "see" their opponent, or continue betting as normal.

However, during a showdown (2 players remaining) if one player is blind and the other isn't, the player who isn't blind may not call to "see" the opponent's cards.

Once a player has bet to "see" the opponent's hand, both hands are then revealed and the best hand wins the pot. If there's a tie, the player who is "seeing" loses.

After play, the remaining cards are placed at the bottom of the deck. If a hand is seen and won by a prial, then the deck is shuffled. Otherwise, the deck is dealt unshuffled.

!rank: For prials: 2-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A-3. Otherwise: 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A.

!note: The highest-ranking run is A-2-3. Runs do not wrap around, so K-A-2 is invalid. The next highest-ranking run, therefore, is A-K-Q.
