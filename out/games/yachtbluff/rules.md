Choose a starting player by any means.

## Play

The game follows the same rules as regular Yacht Dice.

Each player, on their turn, has 3 attempts to make the best dice hand they can, and score the value of the dice on the score sheet.

Players must roll 5 dice on their first turn, then either roll 1 or more, or, if they're happy with their score, submit their score to the sheet early.

Once a player has scored a category, they may not score that category again.

## Scores

Each category scores different points:

| Category                              | Points                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Aces                                  | Sum of dice with 1's                |
| Twos                                  | Sum of dice with 2's                |
| Threes                                | Sum of dice with 3's                |
| Fours                                 | Sum of dice with 4's                |
| Fives                                 | Sum of dice with 5's                |
| Sixes                                 | Sum of dice with 6's                |
| Bonus                                 | +35, if Aces-Sixes total 63 or over |
| Choice                                | Sum of all dice                     |
| 4-of-a-Kind                           | Sum of the 4 dice                   |
| Full House (A pair and a 3-of-a-Kind) | Sum of all dice                     |
| Small Straight (1-2-3-4-5)            | +30                                 |
| Large Straight (2-3-4-5-6)            | +30                                 |
| YACHT (5-of-a-Kind)                   | +50                                 |

If a player cannot score any category, they must choose one category to score 0 in.

## House Rule

The player who isn't rolling wears a blindfold, and the player who is rolling takes their turn as normal, then announces the category they scored. This player may choose to lie. The blindfolded player then decides if the rolling player is telling the truth, and announces their decision.

The scoring differs slightly with the possibility of lying:

| Rolling player | Blindfolded player    | then...                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| is truthful    | thinks it's the truth | Rolling player scores category as normal          |
| is truthful    | thinks it's a lie     | Blindfolded player scores _penalty_ as negative\* |
| is lying       | thinks it's the truth | Rolling player scores category as normal          |
| is lying       | thinks it's a lie     | Rolling player scores category as negative        |

\* in this scenario, the blindfolded player's category is not scored, but instead is scored as negative at the end of the game
