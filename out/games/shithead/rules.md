## You will need
- A standard 52-card deck

## Deal

!rank: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

Choose a dealer by whichever means.

Each player is dealt 3 cards in front of them face-down, 3 cards face-up on top of the face-down cards, and 3 cards to their hand. The rest of the cards are placed in a draw pile face-down in the center.

Before beginning, each player may swap out any number of cards between their hand and their face-up cards.

## Play
Play begins with the player on the dealer's left. The object of the game is to play all the cards from your hand, then all your cards on the table.

Each player in turn places up to 4 cards of the same value in the center; the discard pile. The next player must play up to 4 cards of equal or higher value. If a player cannot play a card, they must pick up the discard pile.

Unless the draw pile is exhausted, players must have a minimum of 3 cards in their hand.

Only when a player's hand is exhausted are allowed to play their face-up cards. If a player has to pick up any cards at any point, they must play them first before continuing to play their face-up cards. This rule applies to their face-down cards as well.

Once a player has played all of their face-up cards, they're able to play their face-down cards. Players must not look at their face-down cards before playing one.

Once a player plays all 3 of their face-down cards, they are out. There are no winners in Shithead. Instead, the last player still in is the loser; or the 'Shithead'. They then become the dealer for the next round.

## Wildcards
Some cards are considered wildcards, and have special rules when played.
