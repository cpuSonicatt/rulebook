## You will need
- A standard 52-card deck

## Deal
To form the tableau, deal out the cards in 7 stacks of 5 cards such that you can see at least the value of each card.

Place the rest of the cards face down to form the stock, and turn over 1 card and place it to the side to form the discard pile.

## Play
You may only move 1 card at a time from the tableau to the discard pile if the value is 1 higher or 1 lower than the top discard card.

If you can't make a move, place 1 card from the stock on the discard pile and continue.

If the tableau is exhausted, you are under par. Count the number of stock cards left and subtract it from your score.

If not, count the number of cards left in the tableau and add it to your score.

A game is over 9 "holes", or rounds. The par over 9 holes is 45.
